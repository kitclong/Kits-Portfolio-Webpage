## Use: 

  Used to practice building a website/personal portfolio page and layout. This was mainly to showcase projects and information of the prospective hire.
  
  **This was also used to fulfill an interest learning Bootstrap! There was a significant knowledge gap, but countless hours online, watching video tutorials, research, more tutorials, trial/error, and more searching; skills were gained! There is still a long road ahead and countless more hours of learning, but the bootstrap introduction was great!**
